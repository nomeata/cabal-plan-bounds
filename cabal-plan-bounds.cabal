version:            0.1.5.1
synopsis:           Derives cabal bounds from build plans
description:
  Manually curated dependency version ranges tend to become a lie: They likely
  include versions of your the dependencies that are neither longer tested by your CI
  system, or implied by compatibility with the tested versions.

  So the conclusion must be to __not write build-depends ranges by hand!__
  Which is an unpleaseant chore instead.

  Instead, __derive the build-depends from your actual CI builds!__

  This tool helps with that. See the README for more information.
